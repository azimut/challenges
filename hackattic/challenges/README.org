All seem to require some *json* decoding to read inputs and encoding to submit answers.

Answers must be given withing a small (?) timeframe.

*** Help me unpack - 5 points

Involves decoding different types of numbers from some given bytes in *base64*.

Took the chance to use Factor's facilities to [[https://docs.factorcode.org/content/article-pack.html][pack]] and unpack binary data.

Struggled a bit due not taking the time to manually count how many bytes were given and how many I was parsing. Unfortunely *unpack* does not tell me if I parse less than the given bytes given.
