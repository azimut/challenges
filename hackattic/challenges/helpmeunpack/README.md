# Help me unpack

5 points

The challenge is to receive bytes and extract some numbers from those bytes.

Connect to the problem endpoint, grab a `base64`-encoded pack of bytes, unpack the required values from it and send them back.

The pack contains, always in the following order:

- a regular `int` (signed), to start off
- an `unsigned int`
- a `short` (signed) to make things interesting
- a `float` because floating point is important
- a `double` as well
- another `double` but this time in big endian (network byte order)

In case you're wondering, we're using 4 byte `ints`, so everything is in the context of a 32-bit platform.

Extract those numbers from the byte string and send them back to the solution endpoint for your reward. See the solution section for a description of the expected JSON format.
