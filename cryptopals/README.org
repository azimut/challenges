** Problem Set 1

- Convert hex string to base64.
  - What?
    - decode hex string to bytes
    - encode bytes to base64
  - How?
    - I used C, reading 6 bits at the time, with bitwise operations.
    - With the help of [[https://bitwisecmd.com/][bitwisecmd]].

- XOR hex strings
  - What?
    - decode hex strings to bytes
    - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operations_in_C][XOR]] bytes
    - encode back to hex string

- Single-byte XOR cipher
  - What?
    - decode hex string to bytes
    - XOR bytes with a single byte
    - measure result for likelyhood of a real msg
    - repeat with a different byte
    - return the result with highest score
