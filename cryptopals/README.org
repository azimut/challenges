** Problem Set 1

https://cryptopals.com/sets/1

*** Convert hex string to base64.

  - What?
    - decode hex string to bytes
    - encode bytes to base64
  - How?
    - I used C, reading 6 bits at the time, with bitwise operations.
    - With the help of [[https://bitwisecmd.com/][bitwisecmd]].

*** XOR hex strings

  - What?
    - decode hex strings to bytes
    - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operations_in_C][XOR]] bytes
    - encode back to hex string

*** Single-byte XOR cipher

  - What?
    - decode hex string to bytes
    - XOR bytes with a single byte
    - measure result for likelyhood of a real msg
    - repeat with a different byte
    - return the result with highest score
  - How?
    - use [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_frequency][letter frequency]] analysis to determine a score for each result
    - use one for english language

*** Detect single-character XOR

  - What?
    - We are given a list of strings
    - Only 1 is XOR'd
    - Figure out which one
  - How?
    - I can't just guess. I needed to improve my scoring algorithm.
    - Found this algorithm/guide https://inventwithpython.com/cracking/chapter19.html
      - Gets a score by counting matches between the 6 most common and 6 most uncommon letters in english.
      - But it didn't give me great results.
    - Found this other one https://wgallagher86.medium.com/single-byte-xor-decryption-and-detection-in-go-451e1c9c52ec
      - Specificaly targetting this exercise.

***  Implement repeating-key XORImplement repeating-key XOR

  - What?
    - apply a XOR key of multiple bytes
    - it's one pass
    - and the bytes of the key cycle
  - How?
    - This turned out pretty easy in comparison now that I have the Buffer class ironed out.
