** Automate (Linkedin) Data Export: Web Script to Download Data
https://www.upwork.com/jobs/~021873053810924000542
** Migration of a Selenium Script to Puppeteer-Stealth with puppeteer-extra-plugin-stealth
https://www.upwork.com/jobs/~021875099602262029955

The objective of this project is to migrate an existing script, currently written in Selenium, to Puppeteer by integrating the stealth plugin puppeteer-extra-plugin-stealth. This migration aims to enhance the script's stealth capabilities, making it undetectable by the target website, while retaining its current functionalities.
We are targeting a site who have a high level of security. We are looking for a real specialist.

- Enable the puppeteer-extra-plugin-stealth plugin to hide common fingerprints (navigator.webdriver, WebGL, CanvasFingerprint, AudioContext, etc.).
- Ensure the script is functional and undetectable on the target website.

* Write a Zeek script to fetch data in real time
https://www.upwork.com/jobs/~021874810321594410894

We are looking for an experienced Zeek/Bro script developer to create a custom solution that achieves the following:
1. SNI/Domain/Hostname Detection:
  - Extract the Server Name Indication (SNI), domain name, or hostname of every outbound SSL/HTTP connection.
  - Log this data for monitoring purposes.
2. Application-Level Response Time Calculation:
  - Capture the total application-layer response time for every HTTP/HTTPS request.
  - This includes the complete lifecycle of a request, encompassing:
    - DNS resolution.
    - SSL negotiation.
    - TCP handshake.
    - Connection establishment.
    - Data transfer and resource download.
  - The goal is to have response time metrics similar to those provided by web servers like Apache or Nginx.
