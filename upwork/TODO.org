* Write a Zeek script to fetch data in real time
https://www.upwork.com/jobs/~021874810321594410894

We are looking for an experienced Zeek/Bro script developer to create a custom solution that achieves the following:
1. SNI/Domain/Hostname Detection:
  - Extract the Server Name Indication (SNI), domain name, or hostname of every outbound SSL/HTTP connection.
  - Log this data for monitoring purposes.
2. Application-Level Response Time Calculation:
  - Capture the total application-layer response time for every HTTP/HTTPS request.
  - This includes the complete lifecycle of a request, encompassing:
    - DNS resolution.
    - SSL negotiation.
    - TCP handshake.
    - Connection establishment.
    - Data transfer and resource download.
  - The goal is to have response time metrics similar to those provided by web servers like Apache or Nginx.
