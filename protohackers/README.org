My solutions to the network protocol challenges of [[https://protohackers.com/][protohackers]].

** Challenges

*** 00 Smoke Test

An TCP based [[https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc862.html][echo server]].

One it's extra requirements
- with no data, it should immediately close connection.
- it should handle half-duplex shutdowns, terminating it, instead of passing on the half-duplex shutdown

*** 01 Prime Time

A server that talks JSON, accepting multiple requests in json format per connection.

#+begin_src sh
  $ { jo method=isPrime number=3; jo method=isP; jo method=isPrime number=10; } | nc 127.0.0.1 1234
  {"method":"isPrime","prime":true}
  {"error":"r2r failed!"}
  {"method":"isPrime","prime":false}
#+end_src

*** 02 Means to an End

A per connection, in-memory db, controlled by a custom network binary protocol.

#+begin_src
Byte:  |   0   |  1     2     3     4  |  5     6     7     8  |
Type:  |  char |         int32 (BE)    |         int32 (BE)    |
Value: |  'I'  |       timestamp       |         price         |
Value: |  'Q'  |        mintime        |        maxtime        |
#+end_src

Lessons learned
- You can only ~print~ byte-arrays on a binary encoded ~threaded-server~. Nothing else or it will silently fail.
- Read the [[https://docs.factorcode.org/content/article-stream-binary.html][docs]] about binary streams.
- You can capture tcp traffic data with [[https://www.wireshark.org/][Wireshark]] to later replay it for a way to test your code offline.

*** 03 Budget Chat

A TCP based ascii chatroom. With nicks and message status on join/leave.

Unlike the other ones I did this one offline. No second tries.

Luckly Factor has the necessary primitives for this. I choose [[https://docs.factorcode.org/content/vocab-concurrency.mailboxes.html][mailboxes]] and [[https://docs.factorcode.org/content/vocab-threads.html][threads]]. There are also channels available but, inlike mailboxes they are 2sides blocking.

*** 04 Unusual DB

An UDP based key/value store.

Can't use ~<threaded-server>~ with UDP. But found an [[https://re.factorcode.org/2010/04/what-time-is-it-part-2.html][article]] implementing a simple udp server.

Unfortunately Factor seems unable to ~receive~ empty UDP packets/datagrams. Which are a requirement for this challenge.

*** 05 Mob in the middle

An evil tcp proxy for the chat protocol made on exercise #3. It rewrites some very specific text content.

Hit a couple of "fun" challenges.

- Ensuring both sides of the connection get closed correctly. For that I learned about Factor's [[https://docs.factorcode.org/content/article-destructors-using.html][destructors]].
- **TODO** Ensuring messages are separated by a newline. This is a more strict requirement than on exercise #3. Seems like is not possible by ~readln~.
  - Golang's ~bufio~ [[https://pkg.go.dev/bufio#Reader.ReadString][ReadString('\n')]] handles this a bit more correctly as it threats EOF without ~\n~ as an error.
  - See ~$ echo -n foobarbaz | socat  - TCP:127.0.0.1:4321~.
- My code still pollutes process stdout with exceptions for closed sockets exceptions not handled...but YOLO.

** Dev

*** Tunnel

External access setup using [[https://pinggy.io/][pinggy.io]].

- For TCP: ~ssh -p 443 -R0:127.0.0.1:1234 qr+tcp@free.pinggy.io~
- For UDP:
  - Tried [[https://pinggy.io/blog/ngrok_udp_alternative/][pinggy]]: ~pinggy -p 443 -R0:127.0.0.1:1234 udp@free.pinggy.io~
  - But doesn't seem to work for the edge-case of empty UDP packets. I get an ICMP port unreachable for it.

*** Testing

- For TCP/UDP: ~nc~ or ~socat~. I prefer ~socat~ due being non-interactive.
  #+begin_src sh
    $ echo -n "" | nc 127.0.0.1 1234
    $ echo -n "" | socat - TCP:127.0.0.1:1234
    $ echo -n "" | socat - UDP:127.0.0.1:1234
  #+end_src

- For UDP: I found ~nmap~ or ~nping~ useful to craft custom packets and see it's output.
  - nping: in particular, can show the data sent and received back in one command.
  #+begin_src
  $ sudo nping -v3 --bpf-filter='udp and dst port 53' -c 1 --data-string="foo" --udp -p 1234 127.0.0.1
