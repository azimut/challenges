Noah’s Market

Welcome to “Noah’s Market”, a bustling mom-and-pop everything store in Manhattan. In recent years it’s become quite an operation, but they’re still running on the same database your cousin Alex set up at the start of 2017.

This morning, while waiting for your breakfast bagel, your Aunt Sarah pulled you aside in a hustle.

“You know how Noah’s been talking recently about that rug we used to have?”

She looked over at Noah, who was talking to a customer: “Such a beautiful carpet, with the most intricate design! I miss having it in my den. It has this vibrant beehive buzzing in the corner…”

Sarah explained, “Noah entrusted me with that rug when he was remodeling his den a few years ago. It was so old and filthy, that I sent it to the cleaners, but then I completely forgot about it. Now, with Noah retiring and me taking over the store, he wants it back. So yesterday I freaked out and combed my apartment, and I finally found a claim ticket saying, ‘All items must be picked up within 90 days.’ At the cleaners, they didn’t have the rug, just the other half of the ticket.”

Sarah added, “I need to find that rug before Noah comes over on the last night of Hanukkah. I have an idea but I need some help, and Alex will be busy for weeks doing those Advent of Code challenges.

“Do you think you could help me track down the rug?”

She hands you a USB drive labeled “Noah’s Market Database Backup”.

“Alex set up the backups to be password-protected. I can never remember the password itself, but it’s just the year in the Hebrew calendar when Alex set up the database.”

What’s the password to open the .zip files on the USB drive?
