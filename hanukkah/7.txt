7. The Meet Cute

“Oh that tapestry, with the colorful toucan on it! I’ll tell you what happened to it.

“One day, I was at Noah’s Market, and I was just about to leave when someone behind me said ‘Miss! You dropped something!’

“Well I turned around to see this cute guy holding an item I had bought. He said, ‘I got the same thing!’ We laughed about it and wound up swapping items because I wanted the color he got. We had a moment when our eyes met and my heart stopped for a second. I asked him to get some food with me and we spent the rest of the day together.

“Before long I moved into his place, but the romance faded quickly, as he wasn’t the prince I imagined. I left abruptly one night, forgetting the tapestry on his wall. But by then, it symbolized our love, and I wanted nothing more to do with it. For all I know, he still has it.”
